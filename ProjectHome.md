A Java 1.5 Parser with AST generation and visitor support. The AST records the source code structure, javadoc and comments. It is also possible to change the AST nodes or create new ones to modify the source code.

**Main features**
  * light weight
  * good performance
  * easy to use
  * AST can be modified
  * AST can be created from scratch

This parser was created using [javacc](https://javacc.dev.java.net/) (the java compiler compiler). All the nodes of the AST, visitors and other features was coded manually using the [Eclipse IDE](http://www.eclipse.org).
